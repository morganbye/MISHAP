\begin_layout Chapter
General
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is MISHAP?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP is the open-source MMM 
\emph on
in silico 
\emph default
simulated spin label to HADDOCK program.
 It combines several MatLab scripts, functions, programs and user interfaces
 as well as a set of additional parameter files for HADDOCK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP aims to take spin labelled proteins and the distance distributions
 between labels from 
\emph on
in silico 
\emph default
(MMM) calculations or experimental data (from pulsed electron-electron double
 resonance experiments which have been analysed with DeerAnalysis) and pass
 them to the biomolecular docking program HADDOCK as docking restraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Functionality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP provides the ability to generate HADDOCK compatible PDB files of
 single chains of amino acids where one or more residues have been substiuted
 for nitroxide spin label attached cysteine residues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP can generate distance based docking restraints from pulsed EPR experiment
s (PELDOR/DEER) when they have been analysed with DeerAnalysis or MMM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generated PDB files can be used in conjunction with or without the MISHAP
 generated distance based docking restraints to help determine the docking
 of protein complexes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, MISHAP only supports the generation of models and restraints
 in proteins.
 Though the open-source nature will allow for the expansion of MISHAP to
 accept non-nitroxide spin labels, DNA, RNA and other common ligands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user interface of MISHAP initially consists of a simple installer that
 installs MISHAP as well as modifying any existing installations of MMM
 and HADDOCK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After installation the user interface largely consists of 2 windows.
 The first handles the distance restraints whilst the second handles the
 generation of HADDOCK compatible PDB files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changes to HADDOCK allow for the user to continue using HADDOCK normally
 via the command line with the addition of being able to use the residues
 R1A (MTSL attached cysteine) and IA1 (IA-PROXYL attached cysteine).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP is designed to be as intuitive as possible whilst still maintaining
 user control.
 With this in mind, all options are clearly labelled as well as extensively
 documented in this document as well as online at morganbye.net/mishap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting MISHAP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP is available online from 2 locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP general releases (for most users) should be downloaded from:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mishap/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MISHAP developer releases (constantly updated and should be considered unstable)
 can be obtained from the git repositary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
https://github.com/morganbye/MISHAP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you can create a new git folder and pull the repository directly
 from the command line with:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installing MISHAP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If MISHAP was downloaded from sourceforge then it will come as a ZIP file
 which includes everything required.
 Simply unpack the ZIP file into a directory of your choosing.
 The folder should contain several text files including; 
\family typewriter
LICENSE.txt
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
README.txt
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
UPDATE.txt
\family default
.
 There will also be 
\family typewriter
MISHAP.m
\family default
; the main MatLab file and 2 directories: 
\family typewriter
test_files
\family default
 containing some example files (referenced later) and _private which contains
 all the files associated with MISHAP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extracted folder needs to be added to the MatLab path with subfolders
 to the; this can be done be navigating to the folder in the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Section
Change history
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Release v13.6 - BETA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v13.6 is the first publicly available release of MISHAP and marks the first
 build from alpha.
 It shows far greater error handling, Windows compatibility and an improved
 graphical user interface.
 MMM and MatLab programming is complete but significant errors still occur
 in HADDOCK/CNS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Build v13.5 - ALPHA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v13.5 is the first functional build of MISHAP that generates distance distributio
n constraints and MMM rotamer merged PDBs.

\begin_layout Section
MMM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MMM is an open-source program for the visualisation, inspection and improvement
 of models of proteins and protein assemblies based on restraints from multiple
 experimental techniques, though primarily focussing on experimental techniques
 from electron paramagnetic resonance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps MMM's most useful feature is the ability to calculate the rotamer
 populations of nitroxide spin labels attached to proteins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For MISHAP we require these spin label attached protein models.
 To generate a rotamer model first start MMM from the MatLab command window

MISHAP
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This begins the installation of MISHAP.
 The installer addresses 3 different programs in turn.
 First the installer looks to see if MISHAP has previously been installed,
 if so then the installer aborts and simply loads MISHAP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If MISHAP has not previously been installed then the installation begins
 looking first to see if the user has MMM installed (line 36).
 For safety the installer backs up 
\family typewriter
MMM_prototype.m
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
MMM_prototype.fig
\family default
 files to 
\family typewriter
/.../MMM_path/old_files
\family default
 before copying across new versions of 
\family typewriter
MMM_prototype
\family default
, these versions allow you to access MISHAP from MMM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
At a later date this versions will be submitted to MMM and this part of
 the installer will be removed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next the installer asks the user if HADDOCK will be run locally, if so then
 the local copy of HADDOCK requires some new parameter files.
 Again exisiting files are backed up first to 
\family typewriter
/.../HADDOCK_path/old_files
\family default
 before the new ones are copied across.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
As HADDOCK is outside the MatLab environment a system search is required
 and this may take some time.
 As a safety feature, the search for HADDOCK will time out in 10 seconds
 and ask the user for the location instead.

A

 of 0.5 nm is automatically set and the boundaries are plotted as about the
 distance as dotted lines in the same colour as the peak.
 At a later date the

 will be detected and calculated from the plot using a half height analysis
 of a Gaussian fit to the peak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multiple spin systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently MISHAP has support for systems with up to 4 nitroxide spin labels.
 By default it is set for only 2 spins (1 distance), selecting 3 or 4 spin
 labels adds more distances to the table (3 distances for 3 labels, 6 distances
 for 4 labels).
 The distance distribution plot displays each distance in a seperate coloured
 dashed line with the peak's 
\emph on
s(r) 
\emph default
dotted in the same colour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Protein information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the distance distribution tool is being used without the protein PDB
 creator then the table information needs to be completed with the appropiate
 information for the chain ID and residue number of the spin label in the
 PDB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is recommended to generate the PDBs for HADDOCK with MISHAP
 before proceeding further.
 To do so click 
\emph on
Generate
\emph default
 to launch the PDB Creator (see §
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:MISHAP-protein-creator"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Output location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once happy with the information displayed in the table finally check the
 output location box.
 This is the location and file name that the distance restraints file will
 be saved as.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default the file name 
\family typewriter
unambig.tbl
\family default
 will be used and the path will be that of the MatLab path when MISHAP was
 first opened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this is not suitable simply click 
\emph on
Change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
RUN!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the information in the table is correct and the output location is
 set click 
\emph on
RUN!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All information is passed out to the MatLab command window.
 First the constraint generator checks that the table is complete, then
 it checks that it can write to the selected location.
 If the folder does not exist or the user does not have permission to write
 to it then they will be prompted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally the file is created.
 This process should be very fast even on a slow computer, ensure that 
\emph on
RUN! 
\emph default
is only pressed once.

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of the PDB creator is 2 fold.
 First is to ensure that PDB files are generated that are compaitble with
 HADDOCK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the PDB format has first created in the 1970's and has been
 extensively developed, often without any strict enforcement of the PDB
 format meaning that it is quite common for PDB files generated in one program
 to not be compatible with a different PDB handling program.
 Previously MMM conformed well with the PDB format, version 2013 after a
 major rewrite of the PDB writing functions now conforms fully.
 HADDOCK will only accept PDB files in a very explicit format, which differs
 significantly from the PDB standard

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second purpose of the PDB creator is to combine the PDB file supplied
 from a PDB file, directly from the PDB website using an access number or
 from a loaded MMM model with a MMM rotamer analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MMM provides some basic functionality on this account but we require a single
 PDB file where an amino acid residue has been mutated to a spin label attached
 cysteine residue.
 Alternatively, a set of PDBs and a list file that can be inserted into
 HADDOCK as an ensemble of starting conformations.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally the creator merges the selected MMM rotamer(s) with the PDB file
 is created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Briefly, the creator essentially splits the PDB file before and after the
 select residue.
 It then pastes in the rotamer residue and merges the residues before the
 residue, the rotamer residue and residies after the rotamer residue with
 appropiate linkers.
 All hydrogen atoms are then removed as these are prone to causing problems
 in HADDOCK and CNS before finally renumbering every atom in the merged
 PDB so that read sequentially.
 The file is finally written out line by line.

\begin_layout Chapter
HADDOCK configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HADDOCK (the high ambiguity data driven biomolecular docking program) is
 an approach that makes use of biochemical and biophysical interaction data
 such as chemical shift perturbations from NMR titration experiments, mutagenesi
s data or bioinformatic predictions to study protein complexes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally most approaches to protein complex formation relied upon a
 combination of energetics and shape complementarity rather than experimental
 data.
 The previously mentioned experiments are presented to the HADDOCK program
 as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process.
 More formally these are defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues
 shown to be involved in the interaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the original 2003 JACS publication HADDOCK has been extended to deal
 with a large varity of data and complexes including protein-DNA, protein-RNA,
 protein-oligosaccharides and protein-ligand complexes.
 HADDOCK has consistently performed well in the blind protein-protein complex
 CAPRI competitions
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HADDOCK remains a command line tool requiring the generation and configuration
 of many files before a run can commence.
 HADDOCK consists primarily as a collection of python scripts derived from
 ARIA written by Michael Nilges and Jens Linge and makes use of CNS as structure
 calculation software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Spin label definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HADDOCK being designed to accept input data from several different sources
 already has the facility to use several unnatural amino acids such as phosphory
lated CYS, HIS, SER, THR, several methyl variants such as mono-, di-, tri-
 methyl lysine, to name but a few.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus if correctly defined it is perfectly possible to add MTSL and IA-PROXYL
 labelled cysteines as an unnatural, but allowed, amino acid residue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an amino acid to be defined in HADDOCK and the underlying structural
 program CNS requires explicit definitions of all atoms, charges, bonds,
 bond lengths and allowed bond angles (both dihedral and improper dihedrals).
 When combined this gives the modelling software not only the atomic position
 and bonding of the atoms, it also allows for the free rotation of bonds
 - which is essential in the final binding stage of HADDOCK before the final
 energy optimisation in water.

\begin_layout Section
Protocols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas with MMM there is an increasing amount of published data that shows
 that rotamer population prediction from a rotamer library reflects the
 experimental situation, it is not known whether the bond rotation allowed
 in HADDOCK/CNS reflects well with that seen experimentally.
 Previously, the authors of HADDOCK when performing paramagnetic relaxation
 enhancement studies take the spin label and during the early stages of
 docking spawn 4 structures with the spin label in different conformations.
 Docking is then performed in an ensemble style analysis and it is hoped
 that during the allowed side chain freedom stage of energy minimisation
 that starting from 4 random positions will find the overall position(s)
 and not get caught in a local energy minima.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this end, MISHAP provides the ability in the PDB creator to not only
 create a single PDB file but automatically generate an ensemble folder
 of PDB files, with the appropiate HADDOCK file list file, of rotamers from
 MMM with populations of greater than 1 %.
 Whilst a typical MMM analysis can generate up to 100 rotamers on a greatly
 solvent exposed site from the rotamer library most will have populations
 of below 1 %.
 In more rigidly located spin label positions the rotamer population quickly
 reduces in number with the remaining allowed rotamers covering a large
 proportion of the population, in some cases above 50 %, in these cases
 an ensemble analysis may not be necessary and a single rotamer PDB file
 should be sufficient for an accurate docking simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Topology parameters (toppar)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HADDOCK contains a series of files contain all of the necessary parameters
 for amino acid residues, ligands, DNA, etc.
 These parameters largely are default parameters for CNS that have been
 extensively modfied and added to for the purposes of HADDOCK.
 HADDOCK creates CNS scripts and then calls CNS in order to perform docking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that HADDOCK must make use of topology version 5.4 for many of the features
 to work, however HADDOCK by default uses version 5.3 - to ensure as broad
 compatibility as possible the provided MISHAP files provide both 5.3 and
 5.4 topology files.
 The following files from the 
\family typewriter
HADDOCK/toppar

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst it is possible to create these topology parameter files by hand methodica
lly, several tools exist that can speed up the process.
 For example the PRODRG tool

 that can be used to generate CNS topology files.
 This tool is only designed to create ligands and so to incorporate a structure
 as an amino acid requires some modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

 but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
 be made subject to the terms of this License.
 If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
 the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required
 by Section 4(d), as requested.
 If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
 the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required
 by Section 4(d), as requested.
 You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the
 terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
 License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
 license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
 License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike

 any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the
 ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
 granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
 This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection,
 but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself
 to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
 in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
 advantage or private monetary compensation.
 The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
 file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or
 directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation,
 provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection
 with the exchange of copyrighted works.

 The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable
 manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
 at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
 authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
 credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
 contributing authors.
 For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
 Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
 by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
 explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
 by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,

These timings will not vary much with newer machines as MatLab by default
 will not parallelise tasks.
 If your version of MatLab is set up to use parrallelisation these times
 will drop significantly.

 It is highly recommended to perform the HADDOCK tasks on a computing cluster
 or server.
 With a 16 core Intel Xeon server with 16
